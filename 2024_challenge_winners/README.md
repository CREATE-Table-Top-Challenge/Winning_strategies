# Winning_strategies
This repository contains code and strategies from winning teams on the Central Line Challenge from 2024.  

Subtask 1: Surgical tool localization / detection​
- Implement and evaluate a method for detecting all surgical tools in each video frame ​
- Output: bounding box coordinates for all tools in the image​  
- Winner: Group 2

Subtask 2: Workflow recognition​
- Implement and evaluate a method for recognizing the task that is being performed​
- Output: the algorithm should produce a single task label
- Winner: Group 1

Subtask 3: Ultrasound Segmentation
- Implement and evaluate a method using foundation models to segment the ultrasound probe
- Output: the algorithm should produce a single NumPy array for each segmentation
- Winner: Group 3 (double check for complete ReadMe)
