# Winning_strategies
This repository contains code and strategies from winning teams on the Central Line Challenge from previous years.

Subtask 1: Surgical tool localization / detection​
- Implement and evaluate a method for detecting all surgical tools in each video frame ​
- Output: bounding box coordinates for all tools in the image​

Subtask 2: Workflow recognition​
- Implement and evaluate a method for recognizing the task that is being performed​
- Output: the algorithm should produce a single task label


Group 3 was the winner for subtask 1.
Group 4 was the winner for subtask 2.
